# Basic-Banking-System
I have developed a basic banking website for my internship at The Sparks Foundation.

BASIC BANKING SYSTEM:
* Create a simple dynamic website which has the following specs.
* Start with creating a dummy data in database for upto 10  customers. Database options: Mysql, Mongo, Postgres, etc.  Customers table will have basic ﬁelds such as name, email,  current balance etc. Transfers table will record all transfers  happened.
* Flow: Home Page >  View all Customers >  Select and View one  Customer > Transfer Money > Select customer to transfer to >  View all Customers .
* No Login Page. No User Creation. Only transfer of money  between multiple users.

* -> FRONT END:HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT
* -> BACKEND:PHP
* -> DATABASE:MYSQL
